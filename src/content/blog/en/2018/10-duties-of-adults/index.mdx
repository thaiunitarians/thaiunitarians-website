In Thailand, the second Saturday of January every year is the national Children's Day. There would always be activities for children everywhere with the theme along the line of being good, being smart, love your family, love your country, and so on. The same narrative is repeated every year.

It seems to me that we always put our hope for the better future with the children. We always say that todays adults are so corrupted and we must bring the next generation to be better. Yet the same thing keeps on happening from one generation to the next. We love to say that children today will be adults tomorrow. However, adults today are the role models of the children today. Thus, if we want to raise the new generation for the better we must first start by improving the current generation for the better.

Instead of having children sing the famous "10 duties of children", it might be better for them if adults sing this "10 duties of adults" to one another.

10 Duties of Adults
1. Open-minded about religions
2. recognise the value of humanity
3. Always use discretion and judgement
4. Never speaking with disdain
5. Hold true to reasons
6. Respect different point-of-views
7. Listen to younger people with open-mind
8. Don't be egoistic
9. Always improve yourself -- the world is changing and countries are improving, so must you
10. Make yourself useful, say sorry for your wrongs, don't blame other people

10 Duties of Adults is a satirical (or improvement) of the classic Thai song "10 Duties of Children" that every child is taught to memorise and always played during the Children's Day.
