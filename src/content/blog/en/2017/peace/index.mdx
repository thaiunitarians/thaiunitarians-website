Today, to celebrate the third Sunday of Advent, we light the Candle of Peace.

Peace is a precious thing. It is one of the hopes everybody wishes for. It is one thing that is so hard to obtain, yet very fragile and can be broken easily. It is one of the things humans value the most, yet it is so against human nature.

It is hard to write down a definition of peace. Some say that peace is the absence of war, but is it so? Indeed a war is a bad thing and it is definitely not peaceful, but there are many other examples of what people may describe as not peaceful. Oppression, violence, aggression, hatred, or even non-constructive arguments could all be said to be not peaceful.

"[The desire of peace] transcends gender, culture, religion, faith and belief, unites the rich and poor, the old and young, East and West, North and South around a common desire." said Isabelle F. Picco.

Indeed peace is one of the things desired by many, the source of problems are that the way some people trying to achieve their peace is to completely get rid of others. You could be peaceful if you live alone in the world, but is it a world at all?

In the words of Ban ki-moon—the former Secretary-General of the United Nations—"We know that peace cannot be decreed solely through treaties – it must be nurtured through the dignity, rights, and capacities of every man and woman, ... More than ever, it means living with others on the basis of tolerances, respect, and mutual understanding, ..."

We pray for more understanding between people, for all people to be peaceful always.
