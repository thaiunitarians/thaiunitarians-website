Today is the first Sunday of Advent, which by Christian tradition are the four Sundays leading up to Christmas waiting for the Nativity of Jesus. As Unitarians shared the Christian root and also celebrate Christmas, it is common for Unitarian communities to also observe Advent. Many Unitarians also have a tradition of Advent candles by lighting up one more candle every Sunday during Advent; each candle holds a significant meaning and reflection of its own.

The first candle lit on this day is the Candle of Joy, a candle that represents the joy and happiness all year round. By lighting this candle, we remember all the joyful events that happened before, the joyous season that is coming, and the contentious of the moment itself. We remember all people who gave us all the joy we felt, whether they are family, friends, or even strangers who smiled to us on the road. We remember those people whose work made this joyful celebration possible, both directly and indirectly. We also remember that there are people who, even at this very moment, still suffer from various predicaments and still waiting for their joy to come.

Let us pray for all these people who are parts of our joy, who made our joy, who received our joy, and who are waiting for their joy in this joyous season.
