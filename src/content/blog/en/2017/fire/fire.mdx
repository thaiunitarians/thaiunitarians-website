The symbol of Unitarian movement worldwide is the flaming chalice. It is customary in many Unitarian and Unitarian Universalist congregations around the world to open their service by lighting the flame. While it is true that flame is the symbol of our faith, we are far from unique in recognising the significant of fire.

For the oldest of times, people always revered fire and its power. Historic people feared it, then learned to live with it and made use of it. Even today many aspect of our lives still depend on fire and the heat and energy it provides. Humans use fire to cook, to manufacture, to provide safety and warmth, to generate electricity---the list goes forever. As such it is of no wonder that fire has always had a significant spot in people's beliefs and religions. Most pagan beliefs have gods represented by fire. Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindi, Jews---and many other religions---all have fire as a part of their ritual. Fire is indeed among the most universal symbols that ever existed.

But what does it signify? The meaning of fire as a symbol could be so many, and could be different from one person to another. For some, fire signifies illumination, hope, courage---representing all the good. For others, fire signifies death and destruction. We all know the danger of fire and the fearsome power it has to lay waste to everything in its path. Some fire signifies something more mystical, or even holy, like the flaming bush in the middle of a desert. Some fire, on the other hand, signifies sin and evil. For some, fire is the power of nature, the source of life that gives birth to living being. For others, fire is just a result of combustion reaction, no more, no less.

So for us Unitarians, what does fire signify? Some say the flame we light is the flame of truth that never burn out; some say it is the flam of love that lights out hearts; and some say it is the flame of wisdom that illuminates our paths. As usual for us, the meaning and significant of fire are different from one to another. To me personally I think all the meanings are equally valid, and that when we light our chalice, we recognise that oftentimes things simply don't have a single meaning.
